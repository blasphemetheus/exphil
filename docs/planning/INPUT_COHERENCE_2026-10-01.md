# Input coherence: the flicker scoreboard and the MinGRU testbed (2026-10-01)

Follows `ENGAGEMENT_SCAN_2026-09-29.md`. Bradley's direction: understand the
flaw before more training; iterate on the cheapest architecture (MinGRU),
then port the fix; small Mamba is the fallback testbed.

## Scoreboard: `scripts/offline_input_coherence.exs`

Held-out expert game states → the live Agent API, sampled as in play (a
prev-action policy feeds back its own output) → compare the emitted
controller stream with the expert's on the same frames. ~3 min per policy,
no Dolphin. 3 validation games, 29,008 frames. Results in
`eval_runs/1001_coherence/*.json`.

| | Mamba v1 ep2 | Mamba v2 prev-action | v2 ablated (zeros) | MinGRU smoke | expert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| A press-edges / min | **119** | 19 | 33 | **123** | 25 |
| B | 73 | 25 | 19 | 125 | 21 |
| X | 108 | 33 | 31 | 76 | 22 |
| Y | 134 | 26 | 31 | 212 | 30 |
| L | 220 | 46 | 32 | 212 | 41 |
| R | 116 | 21 | 30 | 189 | 8 |
| A edges per expert jab-1 episode (n=8) | 2.4 | 0.6 | 1.1 | 1.75 | 0.125 |
| output repeats previous frame | 0.34 | 0.72 | 0.73 | 0.16 | 0.64 |
| change recall (buttons == expert's on change frames) | 0.32 | 0.30 | 0.40 | 0.32 | – |
| hold agreement | 0.67 | 0.54 | 0.68 | 0.57 | – |
| fully neutral share | 0.32 | 0.25 | **0.82** | 0.30 | 0.27 |

Findings:
1. **Flicker is confirmed, general, and large.** Without its own previous
   input the policy presses EVERY button ~5× as often as the expert (A 119
   vs 25/min; R 116 vs 8). Multi-jab was one visible symptom of a
   whole-controller problem.
2. **The prev-action channel fixes the edge rates** (within ~±30 % of
   expert on most buttons) — the channel does what it is for.
3. **It does not improve change recall** (0.30 vs 0.32): the model is no
   better at knowing WHEN to change input; it mostly learned to hold.
4. **This scoreboard cannot see the live freeze** — the states are the
   expert's, so they never show the consequences of the model's own inputs.
   v2 looks healthy here (neutral 0.25) and self-destructs 4.5×/min live.
   It DOES reproduce the ablated mode's idling (0.82 here, 0.84 live).
   Freezing needs a closed-loop measure (sim rollouts or live games).
5. **The flaw is backbone-independent**: a 430k-parameter MinGRU trained for
   25 seconds on 111 games shows the same 5× edge rates.

## MinGRU testbed

`scripts/train_fox_mamba.exs` now accepts `--backbone min_gru` (name is
historical). Smoke: hidden 256×2, window 80, batch 128, 111 train / 12 val
games (`--max-files 400`), 1601 updates at **8–9 ms/update** (Mamba 512×2:
33 ms) — the whole run is ~25 s of training after ~70 s of replay
discovery + parse. val 3.13. No fused custom call for MinGRU yet (pure
graph); not needed at this scale. Checkpoint
`checkpoints/mingru_smoke_20261001/`.

Caveat: the scoreboard used the Mamba split's validation games; with
`--max-files` the testbed has its own split — pass `--split
<ckpt-dir>/split.json` so the games are held out for the model under test.

## Experiment queue on the testbed (each: train ~2 min, score ~3 min)

Baseline = the smoke config. One change at a time, score = press-edge
ratios (flicker) + change recall; then the best 1–2 get a closed-loop check
for freezing before anything is ported to the Mamba.
1. prev-action, dropout 0 / 0.15 / 0.5 — does more dropout raise change
   recall, and where does edge rate break?
2. prev-action + scheduled sampling (verify it is wired in streaming first).
3. press-event (edge) target without a feedback channel.
4. joint button categorical — expected NOT to fix temporal flicker; include
   as a control for that claim.

## Closed-loop evals (same day) — the freeze is now measurable without a human

### Batched agent path (`lib/exphil/agents/agent.ex`)
`batch_init/2` now accepts WINDOWED policies (rolling `{n, window, dim}`
tensor through the same `predict_fn`; cold rows tile their first frame like
`pad_sequence`) and the PREV-ACTION channel (per-row last emitted
controller; `batch_observe(..., controllers: [...])` warms it from recorded
history). Previously the batch path was carried-state GRU only and rejected
prev-action. Parity, deterministic, 150 frames: single path == batch row
150/150 for Mamba v1 and for v2 with the channel.

### `scripts/sim_closed_loop.exs` — policy drives port 1 in the NIF sim, 32 envs × 1800 frames vs an idle opponent (~35 s)

| | Mamba v1 | Mamba v2 prev-action | v2 ablated | MinGRU smoke | (live, Bradley) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| SD / min | 1.25 | **3.75** | 0.44 | 0.44 | v1 1.05 · v2 4.5 · ablate 1.1 |
| damage dealt / min | 75.6 | **13.9** | 4.6 | 85.6 | |
| kills / min | 1.31 | 0.25 | 0.0 | 0.0 | |
| neutral controller share | 0.40 | 0.54 | **0.96** | 0.33 | v1 0.25 · v2 0.37 · ablate 0.84 |
| output repeats previous | 0.49 | 0.77 | 0.95 | 0.15 | |
| self-inflicted offstage → back | 0.77 | 0.56 | 0.70 | 0.88 | |

It reproduces all three live observations: v1 plays and SDs about once a
minute; v2 SDs 3× as often and barely fights; v2-with-zeros stands still.
This is the eval the offline scoreboard could not be.

### `scripts/recovery_drill.exs` — 36 offstage starts, 8 trials each, neutral opponent

Starts are captured in the sim (v1 vs v1; port 1 leaving hitstun airborne and
offstage; kept only if `ExPhil.Melee.Checkmate` says recoverable), with the
previous 79 states + inputs to warm the window and the prev-action channel.

| | recovered | cases never recovered |
| --- | --- | --- |
| neutral controller (floor) | 0.139 | 31/36 |
| Mamba v1 ep2 | **0.267** | 12/36 |
| Mamba v2 prev-action | 0.174 | 16/36 |
| v2 ablated | 0.115 | 27/36 |
| MinGRU smoke | 0.156 | 18/36 |

Ordering matches (v1 > v2 > ablated ≈ doing nothing), and the absolute
level is the bigger finding: **the best imitation policy recovers about a
quarter of positions the static model calls recoverable.** Caveats: the
Checkmate "recoverable" label means a plan exists, not that it is easy; no
expert baseline here (see next); 36 cases.

Two harness bugs caught on the way, both by a validity control: (1) the
first drill mined cases from held-out replays and seeded them with
`Sim.Seed.from_replay` — replaying the EXPERT's own inputs recovered 10 %,
because the seeded sim state was not the replay's state on Fox-vs-Marth /
Falco games on PS/BF (positions differ by tens of units by frame ~900;
`divergence` reports nil). Replay seeding is NOT bit-exact outside the
configuration it was validated on — GOTCHA #137. (2) deaths were missed
when judged by the stock field alone (a dead Fox on the respawn platform
scored as "timeout", then "recovered" once it stepped off) — outcome rule
now includes death/rebirth action states 0–13.

Gate for the experiment queue, per variant: offline press-edge ratios
(flicker) AND closed-loop SD/min + damage/min + neutral share (freezing),
plus the recovery drill. A variant must beat v1-style baselines on flicker
without losing on the closed-loop numbers.

## Queue item 1 result (15:20) — per-frame prev-action dropout does not fix freezing

MinGRU 256×2, 3000-file slice, same split + seed; unit `exphil-coh-queue1`,
outputs `eval_runs/1001_queue/<name>/`. Offline rows feed the policy its OWN
previous output; closed loop = 32 envs × 1800 frames vs idle; drill = 36 × 8.

| | base (no channel) | prev, dropout 0 | prev, dropout 0.15 | prev, dropout 0.5 | expert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| val loss (teacher-forced for prev) | 2.43 | 1.04 | 1.14 | 1.44 | |
| A press edges / min | 100 | 15.5 | 14.8 | 8.7 | 13.2 |
| R press edges / min | 247 | 28.6 | 24.7 | 6.2 | 8.3 |
| change recall | 0.238 | 0.289 | 0.267 | 0.029 | |
| hold agreement | 0.627 | 0.573 | 0.530 | 0.029 | |
| closed loop: damage dealt / min | **56.8** | 10.5 | 20.4 | 0.5 | |
| closed loop: kills / min | 1.06 | 0.13 | 0.19 | 0.0 | |
| closed loop: SD / min | 1.25 | 1.13 | 1.13 | 0.06 (does not move) | |
| closed loop: output repeats previous | 0.29 | 0.62 | 0.62 | 0.83 | 0.76 |
| recovery drill: recovered | **0.278** | 0.167 | 0.146 | 0.104 | |
| recovery drill: cases never recovered | 5/36 | 19/36 | 19/36 | 25/36 | |

Channel zeroed at inference (`coherence_ablate.json`): dropout 0.15 → neutral
0.94; dropout 0.5 → neutral 0.81, A edges 53/min.

Reading:
- **The testbed is faithful.** MinGRU reproduces the Mamba pair: the channel
  brings press edges to expert rates and costs 3–5× damage and ~40 % of
  recoveries. Experiments here should transfer.
- **Change recall barely moves (0.24 → 0.29).** The channel does not teach
  WHEN to change input; it teaches "repeat what I just did", which is right
  on 76 % of frames. Flicker and freezing are the same missing skill under
  two samplers: without the channel each frame is sampled afresh (too many
  edges); with it the policy copies (too few decisions).
- **Per-frame dropout is the wrong tool for a recurrent model.** The mask is
  drawn independently per frame (`data.ex` `slot_at`), so within an 80-frame
  window the model still sees its previous input on most frames and can
  carry it across the gaps in its recurrent state. It never has to act
  without the channel — which is why a dropout-trained model idles when the
  channel is zeroed for a whole window (0.81–0.94 neutral), and why raising
  the rate did not help. To train "play without it" the mask must cover the
  whole window (per-sequence dropout).
- Dropout 0.5 with the channel on latches a non-neutral held input (neutral
  0.005, hold agreement 0.03). Mechanism not established; it is a
  self-feedback effect (teacher-forced val is a normal 1.44).

Consequences for the queue: drop "heavier dropout". Remaining candidates,
each tied to the diagnosis above:
1. per-WINDOW channel dropout (p≈0.3–0.5): the policy must be competent
   both with and without the channel; tests whether the copy shortcut is
   what crowds out the state-driven behaviour.
2. scheduled sampling (feed the model's own sampled previous output during
   training): attacks the train/play mismatch directly; streaming wiring to
   verify first.
3. press-event target, no channel: makes "when to change" the thing the
   loss scores.
4. joint button categorical, control.

## Carried-state Mamba inference (15:25)

`stateful_step: true` now works for Mamba (single + batched paths):
`Edifice.SSM.Mamba.step/3` carries the SSM state and a conv ring buffer per
layer instead of re-running the 80-frame window. On Mamba v1 ep2 (trained
WINDOWED, never saw more than 80 frames from a zero state):

| | windowed | carried |
| --- | --- | --- |
| argmax controller agreement vs windowed, frames 0–79 / 80–299 / 300–1499 | — | 0.988 / 1.000 / 0.993 |
| single-agent median latency | 2.23 ms | 0.92 ms |
| closed loop 32 envs × 3600: SD / min | 1.28 | 1.28 |
| damage dealt / min | 77.0 | 79.1 |
| kills / min | 1.44 | 1.91 |
| batched step | 17 ms | 14 ms |

The windowed-trained model tolerates unbounded carried state: its effective
memory is shorter than the window, so the two modes compute nearly the same
function. Carried inference is therefore safe to use today (2.4× cheaper per
frame); `--stateful-resync` is not needed. It also means carried-state
TRAINING (fused scan kernel taking/returning state, contiguous chunks) would
only pay off if the model learns to use context beyond 80 frames — a
capacity bet, not a prerequisite. Not started. Test:
`test/exphil/agents/agent_stateful_mamba_test.exs`; outputs
`eval_runs/1001_carried/`.

## Queue 2 result (10-01 16:16) — block dropout gives two policies in one, not a fix

MinGRU, prev-action with dropout drawn per 240-frame block
(`--prev-action-dropout-block 240`), each scored with the channel on and
with it zeroed at inference. Unit `exphil-coh-queue2`, 42 min, clean exit.

| | base (queue 1) | blk 0.3, channel on | blk 0.3, zeroed | blk 0.5, channel on | blk 0.5, zeroed | expert |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| val loss | 2.43 | 1.56 | | 1.81 | | |
| A press edges / min | 100 | 21.2 | 114 | 13.2 | 92.7 | 13.2 |
| R press edges / min | 247 | 28.9 | 228 | 42.0 | 227 | 8.3 |
| change recall | 0.238 | 0.271 | 0.283 | 0.300 | 0.271 | |
| damage dealt / min | 56.8 | 22.0 | 29.8 | 17.7 | 29.9 | |
| kills / min | 1.06 | 0.25 | 0.25 | 0.38 | 0.56 | |
| SD / min | 1.25 | 1.06 | 0.69 | 1.25 | 0.69 | |
| output repeats previous | 0.29 | 0.69 | 0.28 | 0.65 | 0.31 | 0.76 |
| recovery drill | 0.278 | 0.174 | 0.233 | 0.194 | 0.267 | |

Reading:
- Block dropout did what per-frame dropout could not: with the channel
  zeroed the policy now PLAYS (neutral 0.29–0.45, not 0.81–0.94) and
  recovers like the base model (0.23–0.27).
- But it did not merge the two behaviours. With the channel on it is the
  prev-action policy again (edges at expert rate, damage 18–22, recovery
  0.17–0.19); with it off it is the base policy again (5–10× edges). One set
  of weights holds both modes and the channel selects between them.
- So the low-damage mode is not caused by the channel crowding out
  state-driven skill during training — the skill is there (zeroed rows). It
  is caused by what the policy does when it SEES its own last input: it
  defers to it. That is an inference-time feedback effect, which
  input-side masking cannot reach.
- Change recall is 0.27–0.30 in all six columns, as in queue 1. No variant
  so far has moved the thing that would fix both symptoms.
- The zeroed rows deal about half the base model's damage (30 vs 57); the
  capacity is shared between two modes.

Dropout on the input (per frame or per block) is closed as a fix. What is
left attacks either the feedback itself (scheduled sampling: train on own
sampled outputs) or the objective (press-event target: score the decision
to change).
